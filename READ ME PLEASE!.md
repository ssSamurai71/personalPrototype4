# How To Play The Game
This read me will eplain how to start the game. The application to run the game is called `New Unity Project (1)` . The reason why it called that is because I was hasty  when I made the game. You are free to run it, however windows defender may try to block you since it treats it as an unsafe download. Just let it run and you should be good.

## Playing The Game
At the start you have zero currency. 

Click on the button that says:  `CLICK MEEEEEEE!!!!!!! `

By clicking on that button, you'll generate life which is the currency of the game. That currency is how you'll buy buildings and upgrades. 

To buy upgrades and buildings, just hover over the building button and click on building or upgrade you want. 

## Bugs
The `Buy Max Upgrade Buttons` are broken at the moment. They provide currency, unlock achievements, but don't actually buy the upgrades. Please avoid using these functions.
