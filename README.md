# personalPrototype4

This is an idle game that I made during my last year of college. It was a fun experince but also felt very unmotivatied in from all of my other classes. 
The achievement folder is an asset that I found to implement an achievements in my game. It was a decent asset but slows down after adding a hundred or so achievements. 
I didn't make the achievement folder. Everything else that is laying around in the main branch is my own work.
